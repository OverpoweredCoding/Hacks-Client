# Hacks++ Client
A hacked client that will interface with the Hacks++ Server

# WARNING + DISCLAIMER
Before you install the client, please read the following so you don't sue me :) <br> Use of this will connect your client to a server controlled by me. By using this client, you accept that your UUID, minecraft username, server inventory data, and server coordinates will be collected and used for identification and optimization purposes. If you don't agree to these terms, don't install the client.

# What is Hacks++?
Hacks++ is a project devoted to creating a massive hivemind of bots on anarchy servers that will rule the world! This is done by the use of people like you voluntarily downloading the client and joining the hivemind. By joining, you'll get many benefits and will not be targeted by the hivemind when you stop using it (as long as you used it for at least 1000 hours).

# What is the Hacks++ Hivemind?
The Hacks++ Hivemind is a collection of all of our users who are botting on 2b2t. The members of the hivemind are controlled via a remote server and will complete various tasks chosen by the developer and public submissions. 

# How do I submit a project to the Hivemind?
You can create an issue request with the tag "Submission" to submit a request. If you want to pay to make sure your request gets approved, reach out to my email (overpowereddev@outlook.com) and we can discuss a price. Please note that malicious projects will not be accepted. I have a moral compass and am not one of those people who will do anything for money.

# Benefits of using
This is a version of impact client with my server integration added to it. The client functions as a normal hacked client unless you join 2b2t. If you join 2b2t, you client will join a "hivemind server" allowing for massive projects to be completed extremely quickly. On 2b2t, you'll recieve any gear that you pick up from player kills. Seeing as the main purpose of this client is for baiting and hunting down players for gear, player kills are extremely common. Another perk is that you'll be able to escape spawn with ease. The client has it's own menu so all you need to do it press "=" on you keyboard and then press "Escape 2b2t Spawn." The client will automatically map out the spawn region and use baritone to get you to safety. There's also a built-in full-on gear up buttton you can press that will get you full diamond armor and tools from nothing (it doesn't do enchants yet- don't make me suffer any more than I already have). Another cool quirk is the built-in macro keybind mod language. It allows you to program your own actions extremely easily. <br> <br>
Here's an itemized list for all of you nerds who want to see that: <br>
- All loot drops you pick up from player kills
- Auto escape spawn function
- Auto gear up function
- Calls other bots for backup if on low health
- Ability to take part in large projects and not even lift a finger 
- Impact client able to be used normally on all servers where the hivemind isn't setup on
- Macro Keybind Mod installed and ready to be used for the creation of your own hacked scripts

# Drawbacks of using
The only real draw backs to using this client is the data collection (mandatory in order for the hivemind to operate) and not being able to preform normal tasks. While you are connected to the bot hivemind, you're unable to preform normal minecraft tasks since your account is botting for the hivemind server. If you want to go back to playing normally, close minecraft and launch a normal installation. Other than that, there's no real drawbacks.
